# Issue Lifecycle Tracker

## Overview

The Issue Lifecycle Tracker is an AI-powered feature that monitors and analyzes the complete journey of GitHub issues from creation to resolution. It provides insights into issue efficiency, identifies bottlenecks, predicts resolution times, and helps maintainers optimize their issue management processes.

## Features

### ðŸ”„ Issue Journey Tracking
- **Time in Each Status**: Track how long issues spend in different states (Open, In Progress, In Review, In Testing)
- **Status History**: Complete timeline of status changes with timestamps
- **Activity Monitoring**: Track all lifecycle events including comments, labels, assignments, and milestones

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Predictions
- **Resolution Time Prediction**: AI predicts how long each issue will take to resolve based on similar historical issues
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for predictions (0-100%)
- **Similar Issue Analysis**: Finds and compares with similar resolved issues for better predictions

### ðŸš¨ Bottleneck Identification
- **Stuck Issue Detection**: Automatically identifies issues that appear to be stuck in any status
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: AI analyzes common patterns causing delays
- **Efficiency Scoring**: Rates overall issue efficiency (0-100 scale)

### ðŸ“Š Efficiency Reports
- **Repository Summary**: Overview of all issues with key metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Track whether efficiency is improving, declining, or stable
- **Actionable Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions for improving issue management

## AI Analysis Process

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches all issues from the repository
- Retrieves issue activities, comments, and labels
- Analyzes historical resolution patterns

### 2. Similarity Analysis
- Compares current issues with historically resolved issues
- Uses issue type, priority, difficulty, and labels for similarity matching
- Calculates similarity scores based on multiple factors

### 3. AI Prediction
- Uses GPT-4 to analyze issue lifecycle patterns
- Considers time spent in each status
- Provides resolution time predictions with confidence scores

### 4. Bottleneck Detection
- Identifies common patterns causing delays
- Analyzes efficiency across different issue types
- Provides specific recommendations for improvement

## Configuration
